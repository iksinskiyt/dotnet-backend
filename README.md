## What is this?
I'm following a cool course on .Net Rest Api building, in the future I'll modify this to be a backend of a nice Todo app with front written in flutter

## Tech Stack
For this application I'm going to work with **Flutter**, **MongoDB**, **Docker** and **.NET** of course! Why *.NET* all of the sudden? I just love learning new technologies,
and personally I think that .Net is a very good way of providing backend for your applications.
## The app
I decided to include some AI generated content in the development process and I'm gonna update this readme if ChatGPT or other forms of AI inspire me to do something cool!
First of all I asked MidJourney for a UI design idea. And this is what it generated:

I think that top left design will be the best for my App, so that's what I'm going to go for!
